update on 05/23/2025: thx to [Wentworth1028](https://github.com/Wentworth1028) and [Tiny-Snow](https://github.com/Tiny-Snow), we have LayerNorm update, for higher NDCG&HR, and here's the [doc](https://github.com/Tiny-Snow/SASRec.pytorch/blob/main/Result_Norm.md)👍.

update on 04/13/2025: in https://arxiv.org/html/2504.09596v1, I listed the ideas worth to try but not yet due to my limited bandwidth in sparse time.

---

modified based on [paper author's tensorflow implementation](https://github.com/kang205/SASRec), switching to PyTorch(v1.6) for simplicity, fixed issues like positional embedding usage etc. (making it harder to overfit, except for that, in recsys, personalization=overfitting sometimes)

code in `python` folder.

to train:

```
python main.py --dataset=ml-1m --train_dir=default --maxlen=200 --dropout_rate=0.2 --device=cuda
```

just inference:

```
python main.py --device=cuda --dataset=ml-1m --train_dir=default --state_dict_path=[YOUR_CKPT_PATH] --inference_only=true --maxlen=200

```

output for each run would be slightly random, as negative samples are randomly sampled, here's my output for two consecutive runs:

```
1st run - test (NDCG@10: 0.5897, HR@10: 0.8190)
2nd run - test (NDCG@10: 0.5918, HR@10: 0.8225)
```

pls check paper author's [repo](https://github.com/kang205/SASRec) for detailed intro and more complete README, and here's the paper bib FYI :)

```

I see a dozen of citations of the repo🫰, pls use the example bib as below if needed.
